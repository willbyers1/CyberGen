## 📖 Overview

**CyberGen** is a robust, serverless password generation utility designed for users who prioritize privacy and security. Unlike many online tools that process data on servers, **CyberGen runs entirely in your browser.**

Built with **Vite** and **TypeScript**, it ensures strict type safety and high performance. It solves the problem of creating strong, complex passwords while providing immediate visual feedback on password strength using a modern algorithm.

The project features a **Cyberpunk/Dark Mode** aesthetic with a responsive Glassmorphism UI, fully optimized for a seamless user experience.

## ✨ Key Features

* **🛡️ Client-Side Security:** All logic runs locally in your browser. No password data is ever sent to a server.
* **⚡ Modern Architecture:** Built with Clean Code principles, separating Business Logic (Core) from UI manipulation.
* **🎚️ Full Customization:** Slider-based length control (8-32 chars) and toggles for Uppercase, Lowercase, Numbers, and Symbols.
* **💪 Strength Meter:** Real-time analysis that visualizes password complexity (Weak, Medium, Strong).
* **📋 Smart Clipboard:** One-click copy functionality with instant user feedback.
* **🎨 Modern UI:** A responsive, dark-mode-first interface designed for a modern aesthetic.

  
## 🚫 No API Key Required

Unlike many other tools that require complex setup or paid subscriptions, Cybergen is designed for **immediate, hassle-free use**.
* **Zero Configuration:** No need to sign up, generate tokens, or manage API keys. Just open the app and start generating.
* **100% Client-Side:** Since there is no backend API dependency, the application runs entirely in your browser.
* **Offline Capable:** Works perfectly without an internet connection, ensuring you can generate secure passwords anywhere.

  
## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Core:** HTML5, TypeScript (Strict Mode)
* **Styling:** Modern CSS3 (Variables, Flexbox/Grid, Glassmorphism)
* **Build Tool:** Vite (Vanilla TS Template)
* **Architecture:** Modular (Separation of Concerns)
